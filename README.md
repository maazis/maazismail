I'm a Software Engineer with a long history of involvement in arts and computers. As such, I strive to work on things that have real impact and meaning on the diverse lives around us. Currently working in the Food Delivery Industry at Byte (YC S20) where we are trying to change the way people have workplace lunches through dark kitchens.
